# Simple Scrape - grabs all constants in the order they are used
# Simulate Regional - simulates a region of code around an instruction of interest
# then extracts strings from modified memory
# Simulate All - simulates all the instructions then extracts strings from modified memory
# 
# Simple scrape is brute force and reliable, but fails if strings are not created
# in order. It can also concatenate unrelated strings.
# 
# Simulate regional is the most nuanced and accurate technique, but only simulates forward from a
# seen string so may miss some context.
# 
# Simulate all is brute force and unreliable. It often misses strings if they are created
# using the same registers and has too much ambiguity to stitch together the correct string.
# This mode should be used on specific selections when a look-behind is desired and simulate
# regional is insufficient.
# In the majority of cases, Simple Scrape or Simulate Regional are superior to Simulate All.
